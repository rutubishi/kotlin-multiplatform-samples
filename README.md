## Introduction
Kotlin Multiplatform allows you to write code once and run it on different platforms, thus enabling efficient code sharing and consistent behavior across platforms. This repository aims to provide examples related to Kotlin on `Android, Desktop and Web/Wasm`, demonstrating how KMP can be used to develop applications.

## Projects
1. **CalculatorKMP**
   
    A simple calculator app that is built using Jetpack Compose and runs on Android and Desktop. The app is built on top of the K2 compiler.
